      %h3 Who are we?
      %p
        %span We are senior programmers with decades of experience: 
        machine learning experts, education theorists, designers, craftspeople, craft beer aficionados, and we all love what we do: taking complete beginners from zero to junior developer in 12 weeks.
      %p If you're at a loose end around Commercial Street in London, come drop in: we'd love to meet you.
      %p Without further ado, let's introduce the team.
