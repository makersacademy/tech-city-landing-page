    %h3 Life at Makers
    %p Being a student at Makers Academy is a very emotional journey. Eating, sleeping and breathing code becomes a huge part of your life, but looking after your wellbeing is also critical to becoming a great developer. On site we have Dana, our Chief Joy Officer - a certified yoga instructor who runs daily yoga and meditation classes and is here to look after your well being.
    %p It’s also important to unwind and bond socially with your cohort. We're surrounded by some of London's quirkiest cafes, yummiest street food and busiest pubs. We also host regular events such as Petcha Kutcha lightning talks, games nights, karaoke nights, as well as organising group activities like climbing, go-karting and going to the theatre.

    %h3 Our Story
    %p
      %span Makers Academy was founded by Evgeny Shadchnev and Rob Johnson when they met at Forward labs.
      Evgeny was a classically trained software developer and as he was trying to build out his team he discovered a lack of qualified developers on the market. At the same time, Rob had been teaching himself to program through a book on Objective C and it took him 9 months and 30 hours a week to get through it. A conversation between the two made them realise that while computer science programs were good at drilling students with theory, they were training people to become computer science professors instead of programmers, and something had to be done.
    %p About 4 months after that conversation they started their first cohort &hyphen; in February 2013 - creating Makers Academy - an alternative to university and a vocational route into a job as a web developer, allowing people to switch careers and learn to code in 3 hyper-intensive months. Makers Academy has now been going for over 2 years and has graduated over 300 students.
