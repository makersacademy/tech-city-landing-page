        %span Since we started in early 2013 we grew from two people to a team of fourteen.
        We have graduated over 250 Makers who now work at Pivotal Labs, 8th Light, Thoughtworks, New Bamboo, BSkyB, FundingCircle, the Ministry of Justice, Global Personals, Mint Digital and many other great companies. We are profitable. Our mission is to teach as many people as possible to code well.
      %p To learn, read.
      %p To know, write.
      %p To master, coach.
