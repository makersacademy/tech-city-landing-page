# Tech City Fellowship

Hey Ruben welcome back, hope you had a great holiday!

## Delete me when read

You should delete this text and replace it with a little explanation of what you're doing (as of course we advise students on the course to do).

Also a few notes:

* We fixed the iPhone table bug
* Please don't edit anything inside of bower components, if you need to add images or whatever do it in another folder - we updated bower and it deleted some of the changes you'd made in the folder
* Do you need the other tech city fellowship github repo? If not delete it as we pay for each private repo (we're going to clean them up next week actually)

Thanks,

Leo and Roi
